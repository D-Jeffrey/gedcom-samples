# Gedcom Samples
 A set of GED files for GEDCOM projects, useful for performance testing and comparing outputs from various GEDCOM generators. This collection also features `geo_code.csv` files compatible with [geo_gedcom](https:github.comcolin0brassgeo_gedcom) and [gedcom-to-visualmap](https:github.comD-Jeffreygedcom-to-visualmap).  The geo_code.csv has a timestamp, so if you are leveraging it wiht geocom-to-visualmap then check the `Cache Only` checkbox for a quick load within the need to reverifying the addresses.

 _Treat these files as the information only and the genealogy as non-authoritative. It is based on the best geneology information we have been able to access including myth, legend and sagas._

 Comment from original data source on http:www.daml.org200101gedcom 
 - _royal92.ged is a public domain GEDCOM file containing information on 3010 individuals and 1422 families of European royalty. royal92.daml was produced using ged2daml._

#### From the header:
25 Dec 92

_You may make this Royal GEDCOM available available to whomever.
As you know this is a work in process and have received suggestions,
corrections and additions from all over the planet...
some even who claim to be descended from Charlemange, himself!_

_The weakest part of the Royals is in the French and Spanish lines.
I found that many of the French Kings had multiple mistresses whose
descendants claimed noble titles, and the Throne itself in some
cases.  I have had the hardest time finding good published sources
for French and Spanish Royalty._

_If you do post it to a BBS or send it around, I would appreciate
it if you'd append a message to the effect that I would welcome
comments and suggestions and possible sources to improve
the database._

_Since the Royals had so many names and many titles it was difficult
to "fill in the blanks" with their name.  In the previous version,
I included all their titles, names, monikers in the notes._

_Thanks for your interest.   Denis Reid_
